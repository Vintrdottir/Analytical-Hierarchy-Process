1. Enter the criteria against which the alternatives will be compared (for example: c - costs, s - security, e - efficiency).

2. Determine the significance of the criteria by comparing them with each other by changing the coefficients in the matrix (the default value is 1).

3. Add alternatives (for example: x, y, z) and then compare them against each of the criteria by changing the coefficients in the alternative matrix.

4. The algorithm will indicate the most optimal choice - the most advantageous alternative.
